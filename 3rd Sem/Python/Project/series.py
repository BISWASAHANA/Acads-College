#Consider the following series:
#1,1,2,3,4,9,8,27,16,81,32,243,64,729,128,2187â€¦This series is a mixture of 2 series.
#Write a program to find the nth term in the series. The nth term calculated by the program should be printed on the screen. No other character/string or message should be printed besides the value of the nth term.
